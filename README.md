# Racket Animations

This is a collection of Racket programs that use the 2htdp/universe api.
Some are interactive graphical programs and others are simply animations.

 
## Getting Started

The easiest way to run these examples is to paste the code into Dr Racket,
in the definitions window of the left, press the Run button then call the 
main program in the REPL window on the right with any argument.
for example:

(main 42)
